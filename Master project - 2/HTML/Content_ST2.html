        <p class="parallax-text-header light-parallex-text-header"> A protective landscape </p>
        <p class="parallax-text-paragraph-center light-parallex-text-paragraph"> The landscape around the schools has been thoughtfully designed to provide protection against the elements with minimal disruption to the existing environment. Rain gardens are planted alongside buildings to make the most out of runoff from heavy rainfall, and trees protect the building’s facade as well as providing solar shading </p>
    </div>
    <div class="parallax-text-field dark-parallex-text-field">
        <p class="parallax-text-header dark-parallex-text-header"> A healthy environment </p>
        <p class="parallax-text-paragraph-center dark-parallex-text-paragraph"> Easily accessible green spaces have a measurable effect on the health, wellbeing and educational attainment of learners; therefore, our schools are designed to make the most out of the environment. The schools have dedicated spaces for outdoor learning, physical and social activities as well as horticultural areas, bike stores, and lots and lots of trees </p>

    <div class="parallax-text-field dark-parallex-text-field">
        <p class="parallax-text-header dark-parallex-text-header"> Engaging outdoor spaces </p>
        <p class="parallax-text-paragraph-center dark-parallex-text-paragraph"> Encouraging active engagement with the outdoors means creating outdoor spaces that are stimulating, useful and considerate of the local environment. Pedestrian routes made of carefully selected materials which weave through mixed meadow planting and existing woodland, leading to outdoor seating and dining areas that are made from sustainably sourced, home-grown timber. </p>

        <p class="parallax-text-header dark-parallex-text-header"> The central commons </p>
        <p class="parallax-text-paragraph-center dark-parallex-text-paragraph"> At the heart of our schools is the ‘commons’; a clearly defined civic and social centre of the campus that includes the cafeteria, library and fully configurable teaching spaces. The architecture of the commons works in harmony with its surroundings, with sustainable timber construction and wide glass windows strengthening the connection to the landscape </p>

This fully natural and renewable resource not only captures carbon but also ensures longevity and resilience against wear over time. By utilizing 35% less timber compared to conventional mass timber schools, the project minimizes waste while maintaining structural integrity. Additionally, CLT's aesthetic appeal contributes to the school's ambiance, while its proven benefits to health and well-being underscore its suitability for creating a conducive learning environment</p>

                <p class="parallax-text-paragraph-center light-parallex-text-paragraph"> The school buildings feature a timber envelope designed for resilience against UK weather conditions. This simple yet robust cladding system, complemented by opening windows and acoustic attenuators, facilitates cross-flow natural ventilation, ensuring a comfortable indoor environment conducive to learning. Recessed windows and strategically planted trees offer shade, promoting energy efficiency and enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the campus. Additionally, timber ribs provide visual contrast while effectively shedding water into the rain gardens below, which serve as a sustainable urban drainage system, mitigating surface water flooding and further integrating environmental sustainability into the school's design </p>

                <p class="parallax-text-paragraph-center light-parallex-text-paragraph"> The school campus grounds are meticulously designed to enhance the educational curriculum by offering standardized spaces for outdoor learning within the protective landscape. These include dedicated areas such as the horticulture zone, covered outdoor seating, sensory gardens, and nature trails. Informal pathways, crafted from 100% recycled permeable materials, meander throughout the campus, inviting exploration and fostering a deeper connection with nature. By integrating these diverse outdoor environments, the school provides students with hands-on learning opportunities that promote environmental stewardship, physical activity, and holistic development </p>

                <p class="parallax-text-paragraph-center light-parallex-text-paragraph"> 
                    Preserving the existing landscape while deliberately enveloping the buildings with verdant trees and lush vegetation yields numerous advantages. This approach promotes biodiversity, providing habitats for various flora and fauna, while granting convenient access to nature for all. The integration of Sustainable Urban Drainage System (SuDS) natural flood defenses ensures environmental resilience and mitigates flooding risks. Moreover, the presence of thriving plant life offers opportunities for hands-on engagement with horticulture, enriching educational experiences. Ultimately, by nurturing a genuine interest in the environment among children and young people, this holistic approach cultivates a sense of stewardship and fosters a deeper connection with the natural world </p>
