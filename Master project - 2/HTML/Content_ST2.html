These include dedicated areas such as the horticulture zone, covered outdoor seating, sensory gardens, and nature trails. Informal pathways, crafted from 100% recycled permeable materials, meander throughout the campus, inviting exploration and fostering a deeper connection with nature. By integrating these diverse outdoor environments, the school provides students with hands-on learning opportunities that promote environmental stewardship, physical activity, and holistic development </p>

                    Preserving the existing landscape while deliberately enveloping the buildings with verdant trees and lush vegetation yields numerous advantages. This approach promotes biodiversity, providing habitats for various flora and fauna, while granting convenient access to nature for all. The integration of Sustainable Urban Drainage System (SuDS) natural flood defenses ensures environmental resilience and mitigates flooding risks. Moreover, the presence of thriving plant life offers opportunities for hands-on engagement with horticulture, enriching educational experiences. Ultimately, by nurturing a genuine interest in the environment among children and young people, this holistic approach cultivates a sense of stewardship and fosters a deeper connection with the natural world </p>
